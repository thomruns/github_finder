# GitHub Finder
An app that searches GitHub users and returns profile information

The app uses a simple UI with a Bootstrap Bootswatch theme. The user can enter successive letters that will return matching GitHub users and their profiles.

If a user is not found, an alert message appears in the UI, which disappears after a few seconds.
